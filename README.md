# Luna Beauty

## Purpose and Value

#### User Stories
> A young person is looking for a glittery eye shadow for a party they're going to.

> A person in their mid-fifties want a new foundation that suits their skin tone well. 

#### User Goals
Users want to be able to browse the website for different make up. They want to be able to filter by type, rather than scrolling through every item on the website.

They'd also like shipping costs added to their total, and any discounts automatically adjusted in their shopping bag.

#### Website Goals
To provide users with an easy to use website for browsing make up. To have an attractive home page that showcases a range of products.

#### Competitor Reviews

#### Beauty Bay
Pros
> The home page grabs the users attention with large bold images. The Navigation bar is well set out underneath a search bar, that has icons to log in, see your wishlist, and your bag.

Cons
> Once users click the Nav bar items, a huge dropdown appears with a lot of options, which makes it more difficult to navigate to exactly what you need as the content is overwhelming.

#### Boots
Pros
> Once looking through products, the page is clean and easy to read. Users can add a product straight to their basket. Products that come in a range of colours take you to the product page to select the colour you like before adding to basket.

Cons
> The navigation has a lot of different product types, so users looking for Mascara for example, need to search through three Navigation selections, and then filter for Mascara. On the product page, the information isn't collapsible so there's a lot of information constantly on display.
